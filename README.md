# REUSE website

[![Build Status](https://drone.fsfe.org/api/badges/reuse/website/status.svg?ref=refs/heads/main)](https://drone.fsfe.org/reuse/website)
[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)
[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/git.fsfe.org/reuse/website)](https://api.reuse.software/info/git.fsfe.org/reuse/website)

We're working to make managing copyrights and licenses in free and open
source software easier. This is the website for a guide of best
practices, meant to demonstrate how to add copyright and license
information to a project in ways which allow for more automation.

Most interesting files are located in `site/content/en/`, specifically:

- `site/content/en/spec-*.md` --- Versions of the specifications.
- `site/content/en/faq.md` --- Frequently asked questions.

## Install

There's no installation here, but to test the website locally, run
`hugo server` inside the `site/` directory. Typically, we let our Drone
CI build and deploy the website for us.

## Usage

Go to https://reuse.software/ and enjoy :-) If your project follows the
reuse guidelines, we encourage you to show that in your `README.md` and
similar! You will find this and more developer tools
[here](https://reuse.software/dev/).

## Contribute

We welcome your pull requests and issue reports. This repository does
contain the website, and also the specification, tutorial and FAQ 
documents.

Generally, we invite you to contact and join the [REUSE mailing
list](https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/reuse).

### Translation

The website "chrome" strings are localized using the standard, built-in [Hugo
i18n](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/) support. The Weblate
project for these strings is [REUSE Website
Strings](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/fsfe/reuse-website-strings/).

Translation happens by conversion Markdown into _gettext_ using
[po4a](https://po4a.org). To generate the _.md_ files from the _gettext .po_
files, run: `po4a po4a.conf`. This also regenerates the _.pot_ file, which is
the _gettext_ translation template, and syncs changes to the _.po_ files. The
Weblate project for these strings is [REUSE Website
Markdown](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/fsfe/reuse-website-markdown/).
