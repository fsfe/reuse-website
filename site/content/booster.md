title: "Get help to become REUSE compliant"
---

Implementing the REUSE principles is easy. Even without legal knowledge, project
maintainers can massively improve the licensing and copyright declaration of
their software.

But sometimes, everyone needs some extra help. All you have to do is ask your
friends. That is why we assist Free Software projects with making their
repositories REUSE compliant! That will ensure that your project ships one or
multiple licenses in a standardised location and form, and that each file is
equipped with information about its license and copyright.

## Our offer to you {#offer}

Over the past few years, the legal experts of the Free Software Foundation
Europe (FSFE) and stewards of the REUSE initiative have helped a three-digit
number of Free Software projects to resolve legal issues and become REUSE
compliant, for example as a consortium member of the [Next Generation Internet
Zero (NGI0) project](https://fsfe.org/activities/ngi/).

Equipped with this experience, we will support the accepted projects to
implement copyright and licensing best practices that will help them as well as
their users and re-users. Here is what you get:

1. The projects' contact persons will be invited to a kick-off workshop
   in which the whole process is explained and the most frequently
   questions will be handled.
2. You will receive an evaluation made by our team that identifies
   potential challenges in your project, and recommendations how to
   solve them.
3. With the above and a concise information bundle, you should be able to
   make your repositories REUSE compliant.
4. If you run into troubles, you can reach out to the REUSE team at any
   stage.
5. As soon as your repository is REUSE compliant, we will give you
   practical guidance on how to maintain this status and inform your
   contributors of your best practices.
