## Get in touch {#contact}

Just like Free Software, the REUSE project is based on its community and the people who support and adopt it. Become part of it by joining the [mailing list](https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/reuse) to get to know other users, and influence the way REUSE evolves.

If you seek direct contact with the REUSE coordinators, please feel free to approach [Max Mehl](https://fsfe.org/about/people/mehl/).

## Graphical profile

The REUSE logotype in a few different formats is [available in Git](https://git.fsfe.org/reuse/reuse-ci/).
