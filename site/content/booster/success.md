title: "REUSE Booster registration completed"
---

You have successfully completed the process of registering your project for the
[REUSE Booster](/booster) programme!

After the deadline we will evaluate all registrations in a jury. You will hear
back from us in any case.

But that does not stop you to have a closer look at REUSE already and make the
first steps to adopt the best practices! Check out the tutorial and FAQ, or more
advanced [options for developers](/dev/) like the helper tool, API, pre-commit
hooks and CI snippets.
