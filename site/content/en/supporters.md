We are grateful for everyone who supports REUSE. The ever-growing
ecosystem of specification, documentation, helper tool, API and a lot
more demands time and funds. Thanks to volunteers, cooperating
organisations and projects, as well as corporate sponsors, REUSE can
constantly evolve and improve.

## Users and adopters

A project that follows the REUSE best practices makes its licensing and
copyright situation transparent, ensures that third-party code is attributed
correctly, and makes it easily reusable for other developers. Because REUSE
does not require a registration and can even be used offline, we don't have
precise user statistics. Below you can find some we know of.

* All 1000+ [compliant projects](https://api.reuse.software/projects) of the
  REUSE API
* Many projects of the [EU-funded Next Generation Internet
  project](https://fsfe.org/activities/ngi/) we help to become REUSE compliant
  from the start.
* The KDE community made REUSE the standard for its [licensing
  policy](https://community.kde.org/Policies/Licensing_Policy#License_Statements).
  Also read [this interview](https://fsfe.org/news/2020/news-20201215-01.html)
  about their rationale and path.
* Corporate licensing policies of Siemens, SAP, Huawei, Liferay and many more.
* Large parts of the Linux Kernel with ~70% by now.

If your community or company has implemented REUSE but is not listed, feel free
to [contact us](/resources/#contact).

## Corporate Sponsors

We kindly invite companies to adopt and support REUSE. As standardised
and simple best practices for declaring copyright and licensing
information largely improve internal compliance processes, we are happy
if corporate actors contribute back to REUSE.

If your company is interested in becoming a REUSE sponsor, [please
approach us](/resources/#contact).
