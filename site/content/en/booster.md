title: "Get help to become REUSE compliant"
---

Implementing the REUSE principles is easy. Even without legal knowledge, project
maintainers can massively improve the licensing and copyright declaration of
their software.

But sometimes, everyone needs some extra help. All you have to do is ask your
friends. That is why we assist Free Software projects with making their
repositories REUSE compliant! That will ensure that your project ships one or
multiple licenses in a standardised location and form, and that each file is
equipped with information about its license and copyright.

## Our offer to you {#offer}

Over the past few years, the legal experts of the Free Software Foundation
Europe (FSFE) and stewards of the REUSE initiative have helped a three-digit
number of Free Software projects to resolve legal issues and become REUSE
compliant, for example as a consortium member of the [Next Generation Internet
Zero (NGI0) project](https://fsfe.org/activities/ngi/).

Equipped with this experience, we will keep supporting projects to 
implement copyright and licensing best practices that will help them as 
well as their users and re-users. 

Our REUSE Booster team is actively approaching projects to guide them 
in the journey of making their projects REUSE compliant. With 
individual assessments and direct assistance, we aim to boost the 
displaying of unambiguous and perfectly human- and machine-readable 
licensing and copyright information.

If you are interested in implementing REUSE in your project, and you are 
seeking the support of our REUSE Booster team, don't hesitate to reach us
through our [mailing list](https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/reuse).

As result of our close interaction and support in the framework of 
REUSE Booster, projects such as [curl](https://curl.se/), 
[GNU Health](https://gnuhealth.org/) and 
[cosmoscout-vr](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr) from DLR 
(German Aerospace Center), among others, have become REUSE compliant. 
We will be happy to help you joining them!
