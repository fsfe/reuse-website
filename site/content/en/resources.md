You have already explored parts of the REUSE universe and would like to go one
step further? Read more background, get in touch with the community and help us
spread the word!

{{< component fa="fas fa-users" headline="Get in touch" id="contact" >}}
 Just like Free Software, the REUSE project is based on its community 
 and the people who support and adopt it. Become part of it by joining 
 the [mailing list](https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/reuse) to 
 get to know other users, and influence the way REUSE evolves. 
 Likewise, you can directly contact the REUSE coordinators throughout 
 our mailing list.

{{< component fa="fas fa-rocket" headline="REUSE Booster">}}
 To help even more projects adopt the REUSE best practices, we have 
 initiated [REUSE Booster](/booster/): a program that gives Free 
 Software projects the opportunity to reach out to us and receive help 
 by the FSFE’s licensing experts. Our REUSE Booster team is also 
 actively reaching out to projects. With individual assessments and 
 direct technical assistance, we boost the communication of 
 licensing and copyright information.

{{< component fa="fas fa-exchange-alt" headline="Similar initiatives">}}
  There are many initiatives working on Free Software licensing and compliance.
  REUSE contributes to this effort but does not replace tools and best
  practices in other places of the compliance chain. Have a look at [other
  projects](/comparison) we collaborate with and their specifics.

  The more projects understand and adopt REUSE, the easier use and re-use of
  software is for everyone. Please feel free to use ready material to spread
  the word. The [REUSE graphics](https://git.fsfe.org/reuse/reuse-ci/) can be
