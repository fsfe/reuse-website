We are grateful for everyone who supports REUSE. The ever-growing
ecosystem of specification, documentation, helper tool, API and a lot
more demands time and funds. Thanks to volunteers, cooperating
organisations and projects, as well as corporate sponsors, REUSE can
constantly evolve and improve.

## Corporate Sponsors

We kindly invite companies to adopt and support REUSE. As standardised
and simple best practices for declaring copyright and licensing
information largely improve internal compliance processes, we are happy
if corporate actors contribute back to REUSE.

If your company is interested in becoming a REUSE sponsor, [please
approach us](/materials/#contact).
